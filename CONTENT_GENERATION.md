#### 2. Interactive Template (แบบมีส่วนร่วม)
- **Focus**: Student participation and activities
- **Structure**: Introduction → Exploration → Group Activities → Presentation → Reflection
- **Best for**: Social subjects, collaborative learning

#### 3. Inquiry Template (แบบสืบเสาะหาความรู้)
- **Focus**: Student-led discovery and investigation
- **Structure**: Questions → Investigation → Analysis → Discussion → Application
- **Best for**: Science subjects, critical thinking development
